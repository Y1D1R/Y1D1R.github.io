## Work Experience

**R&D Engineer in Deep Learning** | IRT SystemX (March 2024 - August 2024)  
  Worked on time series classification using deep learning to recognize walking modes (Gait Mode) for robotic orthosis control.
  - Implemented data qualification processes to detect potential issues and artifacts.
  - Developed and benchmarked various models, including LSTM Encoder-Decoder and CNN-LSTM Encoder-Decoder, for real-time multi-horizon classification of walking modes.
  - Analyzed the latent space to interpret patterns learned by the model, with potential applications for evaluating walking patterns in rehabilitation.
  - Optimized response times through downsampling and converted the model to TensorFlow Lite for embedded systems.

## Projects

**Medical Image Segmentation using U-Net** | University Paris Cité (January 2024)  
  - Worked with an electron microscopy dataset of the CA1 region of the hippocampus.
  - Fine-tuned the original U-Net architecture to fit the specific dataset.
  - Evaluated segmentation performance using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Jaccard Index (IoU).

**Hand Gesture Recognition using TinyML** | USTHB (November 2022 - December 2022)  
  - Used two "Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense" devices to detect hand gestures.
